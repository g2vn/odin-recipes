Hi! This project is a demonstration of using Early HTML to build a recipe website.
Within this project, I'll be using beginner HTML to build the framework of the website,
including that of images, links, and more. I'll document my progress as needed.

Ideas practiced: Links, Images, Boilerplate, Syntax, Lists, <strong>, <em>, <br>

Thank you for taking a look!
