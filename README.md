Hi! This project is a demonstration of using Early HTML to build a recipe website.
Within this project, I'll be using beginner HTML to build the framework of the website,
including that of images, links, and more. I'll document my progress as needed.

Ideas practiced: Links, Images, Boilerplate, Syntax, Lists, other elements (strong, em, and br)

*The "New Orleans Creole Gumbo" and "Chicken Tikka Masala" pages were built with the same
frameworks and use the "Lorem Ipsum" type holder, as I learned the general premise of
the project when building the "Fettuccine" Page.*

**Thank you for taking a look!**
